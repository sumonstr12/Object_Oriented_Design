 * In this code, the AreaCalculator class is closed for modification because 
 * i donâ€™t need to change it if you want to add a new shape. 
 * i just need to create a new class that implements the Shape interface 
 * and the AreaCalculator class will be able to calculate its area. 
 * This is the essence of the Open-Closed Principle.

/*
Open-closed Principle (OCP) states:
--Objects or entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
This means that a class should be extendable without modifying the class itself.
